# Neural Magic's BERT-Large DeepSparse MLPerf Submission

This is the repository of Neural Magic's BERT-Large DeepSparse submission for [MLPerf Inference Benchmark v2.1](https://www.mlperf.org/inference-overview/).

## Benchmark

In this submission, we show three different methods of optimizing BERT-Large by combining various methods of compression covering: unstructured gradual pruning, quantization-aware training, and structural distillation. 

Our MLPerf Inference v2.1 submission contains the following results for the BERT-Large SQuAD v1.1 question answering task:

| Benchmark      | SQuAD v1.1 F1 Score (R=X% of Base Accuracy) | SingleStream Latency [ms]  |  Offline Throughput [samples/sec]  |
|:----------------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Baseline [BERT-Large](https://zenodo.org/record/3733910) ONNXRuntime | 90.874 (R=100.00%)	| 188.57	| 5.30  |
| [BERT-Large Prune OFA](prune-ofa_large.md) DeepSparse  | 90.41 (R=99.48%)	| 21.98 | 160.23 |
| [oBERT-Large](obert_large.md) DeepSparse  | 90.21 (R=99.27%)	| 16.89 | 230.74  |
| [oBERT-MobileBERT](obert_mobilebert.md) DeepSparse  | 90.32 (R=99.39%)	| 5.44 | 928.58  |

The benchmark implementation and models are stored in the [code/bert/deepsparse](code/bert/deepsparse) directory which contains a `README.md` detailing instructions on how to set up the benchmark. An example of the commands used to generate this submission is stored in [submission.sh](submission.sh).

The benchmark was evaluated using a server with two Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8380 (IceLake) CPUs with 40 cores each.
